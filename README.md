# birdCloudGnnR

<!-- badges: start -->

[![CRAN
status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/birdCloudGnnR)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=birdCloudGnnR)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of birdCloudGnnR is to facilitate using the
[bird-cloud-gnn](https://github.com/point-cloud-radar/bird-cloud-gnn)
model from R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of birdCloudGnnR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("point-cloud-radar/birdCloudGnnR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
devtools::load_all()
#> â„¹ Loading birdCloudGnnR
#> The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
#> which was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.
#> Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially
#> https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.
#> It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
#> package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
#> The sp package is now running under evolution status 2
#>      (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)
#> 
#> Please note that rgdal will be retired during October 2023,
#> plan transition to sf/stars/terra functions using GDAL and PROJ
#> at your earliest convenience.
#> See https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html and https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution

#> Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
#> Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 3.4.1, released 2021/12/27
#> Path to GDAL shared files: /usr/share/gdal
#> GDAL binary built with GEOS: TRUE 
#> Loaded PROJ runtime: Rel. 8.2.1, January 1st, 2022, [PJ_VERSION: 821]

#> Linking to sp version:1.6-1
#> To mute warnings of possible GDAL/OSR exportToProj4() degradation,
#> use options("rgdal_show_exportToProj4_warnings"="none") before loading sp or rgdal.
#> 
#> Please note that 'maptools' will be retired during October 2023,
#> plan transition at your earliest convenience (see
#> https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html and earlier blogs
#> for guidance);some functionality will be moved to 'sp'.
